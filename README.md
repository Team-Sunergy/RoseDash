Rose Dash provides a starting ground for Solar Vehicle telemetry interfaces using android devices. It can be modified to work on ios and web. For this project we used an Arduino Uno for our microcontroller, an MCP CAN module for CANBUS and OBD2 communications with our Orion 2 BMS, an HM-19 BLE module for wireless communications with a Samsung Galaxy Tab A8, and Verizon Hotspots for interconnectivity.<br>

Schematics and further assistance are available upon request. With peace and <3 - Team Sunergy <br>
