# Arduino -> Tablet communication #

[Bluetooth tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Receive-Arduino-Sensor-Data-on-Your-Android/)
* Sam has the specific bluetooth module in this example, if we want to go this route

## BT vs USB ##
[Does BT really use more battery?](https://www.androidauthority.com/does-bluetooth-drain-battery-1145853/)
This article found bluetooth only used 1% more battery.

* BT does seem harder to implement that serial USB
* USB would also charge the tablet... depending on the tablet this could be unecessary (some have a battery life of >10 hours)

## Notes ##
*We should definitley see what Brad thinks about this*
